# .Weasel landing site

This lander was built using [Astro.build 👩‍🚀](https://docs.astro.build/en/getting-started/), TailwindCSS and [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev/).

The design was taken from this beautiful [site](https://www.workshopsurvival.com/) (except for the weasel references.)

## To get going

1. Clone the repo
2. `yarn install` (make sure you're using Node.js v16.12.0 or higher)
3. `yarn dev`
4. Click on the 'local' link (usually localhost:3000) to access via your browser
